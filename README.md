# Create-a-client-facing-app-that-documents-and-visualizes-how-our-APIs-work-Document
"Create a client-facing app that documents and visualizes how our APIs work" is the project I choose to work with for the Group Project Module at Edinburgh Napier University, in there I was part of a team of 5. In here I put the documents of the project. The actual project is in the Coastr's developer area.
